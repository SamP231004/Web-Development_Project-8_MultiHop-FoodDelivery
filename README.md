# Multi-Hop Food Delivery System

The traditional food delivery model relies on a single delivery agent to pick up an order from a restaurant and deliver it directly to the customer. However, this method becomes inefficient when:

- The restaurant is far from the customer.
- No delivery agents are currently in the restaurant's vicinity.
- A delivery agent is available near the restaurant but not heading toward the customer's location.
- A delivery agent is passing near the customer but not coming from the restaurant.

To overcome these challenges, we propose a multi-hop food delivery system, where orders are transferred between multiple delivery agents in an optimized relay fashion to reduce delivery time and operational cost.
